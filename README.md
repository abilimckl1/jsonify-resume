NOTE: The 'Add Education & Work Experience' cloning feature in Jsonify page may not work properly, due to source code imported as pure native javascript. Some functionalities is not compatible and feasible to be implemented in Vue compared to Javascript. The rest is okay.

UPDATE: fetching date from API endpoint is possible, but writing to API endpoint is not possible after deploying to cloud. Therefore, the upload button at /jsonify is not working now on production, user will need to generate from JSONIFY and manually edit your data here in my db repository https://github.com/abilimckl1/abilimckl1.github.io/blob/main/db.json
